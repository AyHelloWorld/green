subscribing to the course!

The Story
---------

Hi! I'm Nathan Stocks.  I spent several hundred hours creating Green as an open
source project, and I continue to spend hours each week maintaining it.

I would like to _continue_ improving Green, but I would also like to support my
family.  Rather than simply beg for funds, I decided to create something of
value.

I actually get **more** money if you buy the course using one of my coupons.  So
it's a win-win.  Use the coupon and you save money while I receive more money
and can actually spend more time on implementing enhancement proposals and
fixing bugs.

Seriously, **use a coupon!**  Udemy takes up to 75% of the sale for "marketing
the course" if you don't use a coupon provided here.
