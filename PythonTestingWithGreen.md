Python Testing with Green
=========================

[Python Testing with Green](https://www.udemy.com/python-testing-with-green/?couponCode=GREEN_ANGEL)
is an online training course where you can not only learn advanced usage of
Green, but also learn how to write effective, meaningful Python tests and dive
deep into the `unittest` and `mock` libraries.  Please support Green by
subscribing to the course!

The Story
---------

Hi! I'm Nathan Stocks.  I spent several hundred hours creating Green as an open
source project, and I continue to spend some hours each week maintaining it.

I would like to _continue_ improving Green, but I would also like to support my
family.  Rather than simply beg for funds, I decided to create something of
value.

I actually get **more** money if you buy the course using one of my coupons.  So
it's a win-win.  Use the coupon and you save money while I receive more money
and can actually spend more time on implementing enhancement proposals and
fixing bugs.

Seriously, **use a coupon!**  Udemy takes up to 75% of the sale for "marketing
the course" if you don't use a coupon provided here.

Custom Discounts
----------------

I am happy to give custom discounts for students, bulk purchases, user group
meetings, conferences, special needs, etc.  I am also open to paid contract
work to implement your favorite feature
(but only if it won't have a negative impact on Green and the community).  Just
[send me an email](mailto:nathan.stocks@gmail.com).  Note that I'll try to
_eventually_ get to all enhancements anyway, but with two jobs and a wife and
kids it is not like I have an abundant amount of extra time.  

Contributors Get TWO FREE

If you submit a pull request to Green which is accepted, or report a bug in
Green that we accept as valid, I would be happy to send you a code for **TWO
